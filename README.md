# Cake Shops
For this app I use:
- Builder and Factory Method Design Pattern. The first one, I used it to create a statistic of cakes. The second one, I used it for creating the username and the password for every employee. 
- JFreeChart to create statistics of cakes and shops. 
- Serialisation for loading and saving cakes from every shop.
# Introduction
  There are two users : the common employee and the admin. The employee can access the cakes of every shops, can create charts, can saves the reports in csv, json and xml format and also can delete, insert and edit a cake from a specific shop. The admin can add/delete/edit a common employee.
  - Every user need to have a username and a password saved in accounts' file.
  - For every user a window (view) will appear with their rights.
  - IDE: IntelliJ
  - Programming Language: Java
# Pre-requisites
  1. This app is independent of the operating system, but it needs Java.
  2. Make deserialization first, to add products to the menu. After this, you can comment these lines of code, and make serialization for saving products that will be added.  
# Getting Started
  1. Download code.
  2. Open code in a Java IDE (like Eclipse or Intellij)
  3. Run the app.
