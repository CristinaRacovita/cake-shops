# Cake Shops
For this app I used:
- Builder and Factory Method Design Patterns. The former is used to create a statistics of existing cakes and the latter is used to create different types of accounts. 
- JFreeChart - to create statistics of cakes and shops
- Serialisation - to load and save shop cakes
# Introduction
  There are two types of users: the shop employee and the admin. The admin can add/delete/edit any employees. The employee user can:
- access information about cakes from all existing shops
- create charts
- save the reports in csv, json and xml format 
- delete, insert and edit a cake from a certain shop
